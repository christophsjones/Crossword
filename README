A Javascript crossword puzzle solver.

How to format your own puzzle:

Issues:
1. Typing too fast doesn't insert characters correctly
2. Answer checking should be turned off... perhaps only verification of entire puzzle
3. Every keypress advances the cursor, only A-Z should
4. Rebuses?
5. change to capital letters by default
